# E-Commerce Recommendation System

## Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a comprehensive **e-commerce recommendation system** built with **machine learning** techniques. The system combines multiple recommendation strategies—content-based, collaborative filtering, hybrid, and multi-model—to provide personalized product suggestions and enhance user experience on digital shopping platforms.

## Objectives

- **Personalization**: Deliver tailored product recommendations based on individual user behavior and item attributes.  
- **Diversity**: Leverage multiple algorithms to ensure varied and relevant suggestions.  
- **Scalability**: Structure components for seamless integration and future growth.  


## Recommendation Strategies

### 1. Content-Based Filtering
- **Goal**: Recommend products with similar attributes to those a user has interacted with.  
- **Process**:  
  - Extract features such as category, brand, description, and tags.  
  - Vectorize text and categorical data (e.g., TF-IDF, one-hot encoding).  
  - Compute cosine similarity between product vectors.

### 2. Collaborative Filtering
- **Goal**: Suggest items based on user behavior patterns across the user base.  
- **Approaches**:  
  - **Neighborhood Methods**: Compute similarity between users or items using metrics like Pearson correlation or cosine similarity.  
  - **Matrix Factorization**: Decompose the user–item interaction matrix (e.g., via SVD or implicit feedback models) to predict unseen ratings.

### 3. Hybrid Modeling
- **Goal**: Combine content-based and collaborative signals to offset individual weaknesses.  
- **Technique**: Weighted blending of scores from each algorithm, or cascade filtering (e.g., refine CF suggestions with content similarity).

### 4. Multi-Model Ensemble
- **Goal**: Integrate multiple machine learning models (e.g., deep learning with TensorFlow) for richer feature extraction and ranking.  
- **Examples**:  
  - Use a neural network embedding model to learn product representations.  
  - Blend classical CF outputs with neural embeddings in a meta-learner.

## Data Collection & Preprocessing

1. **Data Sources**:  
   - `products.csv`: Contains product IDs, names, categories, descriptions, and tags.  
   - `interactions.csv`: Logs of user-product ratings, purchases, and clicks.

2. **Preprocessing Steps**:    
   - **Cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, normalize text (lowercase, remove punctuation).  
   - **Feature Engineering**:  
     - Extract top descriptive keywords from `description`.  
     - Encode categorical features.  
     - Build a unified feature matrix for content-based filtering.
    
     
## Key Insights:

- Blending content and collaborative signals significantly improves diversity and accuracy compared to single-method strategies.

- Feature engineering (e.g., keyword extraction, embedding models) plays a critical role in capturing product semantics.

- Model serving via Flask introduces minimal latency (~50ms per request), suitable for real-time recommendations in production.
